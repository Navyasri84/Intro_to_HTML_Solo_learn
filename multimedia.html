    <!-- Audio
    The audio element allows you to add an audio player to the page.
    The audio file is specified using the src attribute: -->
    <audio src="audio.mp3">
        Audio not supported
    </audio>

    <!-- The controls attribute displays the player controls -->
    <audio src="audio.mp3" controls>
        Audio not supported
    </audio>

    <!-- Looping
    The loop attribute makes the player automatically start to play the track when it 
    reaches the end. -->
    <audio src="audio.mp3" controls [b]loop[/b]>
        Audio not supported
    </audio>
    <!-- There is also an autoplay attribute that makes the audio start playing 
    automatically, however, most browsers disable this feature as it is annoying to most 
    users. -->

    <!-- Multiple Sources
    Different browsers support different formats of audio. To maximize compatibility, 
    the audio element allows to add different formats of the same audio track using the 
    <source> element -->
    <audio controls>
        <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        <source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    </audio>
    <!-- Now, if the browser is not able to play the first source, it will attempt to play 
    the second one. -->

    <!-- Video
    Playing video is very similar to the audio element: -->
    <video controls>
        <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        <source src="video.ogg" type="video/ogg">
        Video is not supported by your browser
    </video>
    <!-- As you can see, the video element supports the same syntax and the same 
    attributes (controls, autoplay, loop), as the audio element. -->
    
    <video controls width="480px" height="300px">
        <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        <source src="video.ogg" type="video/ogg">
        Video is not supported by your browser
    </video>

    <!-- Embed YouTube Videos
    Another way to embed videos to a page is using the <iframe> element.
    For example, to embed a YouTube video, find a video you like, click the Share button 
    below the video and select the Embed button.
    This will give you a code with an <iframe> element, like this: -->
    <iframe width="560" height="315" 
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o8kT5c_4PAc" 
    frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
