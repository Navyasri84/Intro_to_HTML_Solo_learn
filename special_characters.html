    <!-- Special Characters
    In HTML, the characters <, >, ", ' and & are special characters, and are parts of the 
    HTML syntax itself.
    But what if we want to include these special characters in our text?
    For example, we want to include the < and > signs in a paragraph: -->
    <p> A paragraph is created using the <p> tag </p>

    <!-- To include special characters in text, we need to use character references.
    These are special codes that represent characters; they start with an ampersand (&), 
    and end with a semicolon (;).
    The < sign is represented using & lt; while > is represented by & gt; -->
    <p> A paragraph is created using the &lt;p&gt; tag </p>

    <!-- <----- &lt; 
         >----- &gt;
         "----- &quot;
         '----- &apos;
         &----- &amp;
         Â©----- &copy;
         non-breaking space----- &nbsp;
    -->

    <!-- If you write 5 spaces in your text, the browser will remove 4 of them, but if you 
    use 10 non-breaking spaces, all of them will be preserved. -->
